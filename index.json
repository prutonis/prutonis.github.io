[{"content":"Introduction Being mainly a Java programmer, I decided however to expand my area of knowledge and the fates fell on the Go language. And the best way to learn is to apply, to practice what you learn! I usually prefer to do this by implementing a game or a tool that has some use.\nSo this time it\u0026rsquo;s a game - Wordle, but implemented as a Telegram Bot.\nEnvironment To run Go code, you need to install Go on your local computer. In my case, I\u0026rsquo;m using Windows 10, so I installed the latest version of Go, which is currently 1.20.5, from their website. For development, I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE.\nTelegram Bot I created my Telegram Bot using The Botfather. For more information check the official documentation available here. To create a bot, you need to communicate to The Botfather and request a new bot with the command\n/newbot Wordle Game The Wordle Game involves guessing a five-letter word chosen by the computer. You have six attempts to guess the word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. These tiles indicate whether the letters match or occupy the correct position. However, due to the nature of Telegram, we can only provide feedback to the user using text characters, such as letters and symbols:\nBold letter - indicates the letter is in the correct position. Italic letter - indicates the letter is present but not in the correct position. # - indicates the letter is not present in the word. Implementation You can find the game implementation in this GitHub repository https://github.com/prutonis/wordlebot. Some key points to mention are that I used yanzay\u0026rsquo;s Bot library to communicate with Telegram Bot API. Also I used zap library for logging, the viper for storing and reading configuration files, and GoDtoEnv library for reading .env file where the Bot Token is stored.\nThe entry point of the program is the WordleBot() function in pkg/wordlebot/wbot.go which is called from main.go:\nfunc WordleBot() { Chats = make(chats) Bot = tbot.New(Token) App.client = Bot.Client() Bot.HandleMessage(\u0026#34;/help\u0026#34;, App.helpHandler) Bot.HandleMessage(\u0026#34;/start\u0026#34;, App.startHandler) Bot.HandleMessage(\u0026#34;/giveup\u0026#34;, App.giveUpHandler) Bot.HandleMessage(\u0026#34;/lang\u0026#34;, App.languageHandler) Bot.HandleMessage(\u0026#34;^.{5}$\u0026#34;, App.messagesHandler) Bot.HandleCallback(App.callbackHandler) log.Fatal(Bot.Start()) } Play with Docker If you have access to a Docker instance, you can run the bot within seconds by following these instructions:\nClone the repository $ git clone https://github.com/prutonis/wordlebot Navigate to the wordlebot directory and set your Bot token in the .env file: $ cd wordlebot $ echo TBOT_TOKEN=4839574812:AAFD39kkdpWt3ywyRZergyOLMaJhac60qc \u0026gt; .env Build the Docker image $ docker build -t wordlebot . Start a Docker container from the created image: $ docker run --name wordle_game --rm -d -t wordlebot Now, you can enjoy the game. Simply open your bot in Telegram and type /start or /help to begin.\nFeatures The help menu of the game:\nYou can choose between English and Romanian languages: An example of gameplay: You cand try the game with the Wordle bot instance: Wordle Telegram Bot.\n","permalink":"https://morosanu.io/posts/wordle-game-telegram-bot/","summary":"Introduction Being mainly a Java programmer, I decided however to expand my area of knowledge and the fates fell on the Go language.

It\u0026rsquo;s a pleasure to embark on this blogging journey and share my experiences as a software engineer with all of you. With over 15 years of expertise in the realms of C, Python, and Java, my journey has primarily revolved around backend development. However, I have recently set my sights on the captivating realm of modern frontend technologies. In this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ll take you through my transition, the challenges I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered, and the excitement of expanding my skill set to include the modern frontend stack.\nEmbracing the Backend Throughout my career, I\u0026rsquo;ve been deeply engrossed in the backend universe. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the privilege of working on intricate systems, optimizing algorithms, and designing robust architectures. The world of C, Python, and Java has been my home, allowing me to develop a strong foundation in building scalable and efficient backend solutions. From crafting microservices to wrangling massive data sets, I\u0026rsquo;ve relished the opportunities that have come my way.\nA Shift in Perspective As the technological landscape evolved and user expectations soared, I found myself intrigued by the user-facing aspects of software development. Witnessing the rise of rich web applications and the power of interactive interfaces, I felt compelled to delve into the modern frontend stack. While my core expertise lay in backend technologies, I recognized the need to adapt and embrace the ever-changing demands of the software industry.\nThe Fascinating World of Frontend My journey into the world of frontend development began with curiosity and a thirst for knowledge. The intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript started to captivate me, and I soon realized the immense possibilities they offered. The modern frontend stack, with frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, presented an ocean of opportunities to create dynamic, responsive, and engaging user interfaces.\nThe Learning Curve Transitioning from a backend-focused software engineer to a well-rounded full-stack developer came with its fair share of challenges. Concepts like state management, component-based architecture, and responsive design introduced new paradigms that required a shift in my mindset. However, armed with determination and a willingness to learn, I immersed myself in online tutorials, documentation, and engaging with the vibrant developer community.\nFinal Thoughts In this introductory blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ve shared my background as a software engineer with a strong backend focus and my recent foray into the modern frontend stack. As I continue to grow and learn, I\u0026rsquo;m eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
